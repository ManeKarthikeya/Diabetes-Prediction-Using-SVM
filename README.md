Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

📖 Project Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning classifier to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on diagnostic measurements. Using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained to classify whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic.

This is a classic binary classification problem in the healthcare domain, demonstrating how machine learning can be used for early medical diagnosis and risk assessment.

🧠 Algorithm Used

Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful supervised learning model used for classification tasks. The linear kernel is employed in this implementation.

StandardScaler: Used for feature standardization to ensure all input features are on the same scale, which is crucial for SVM performance.

📊 About the Dataset

The PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable.

Features (Input Variables):

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

Age: Age in years

Target Variable (Output):

Outcome: 0 (Non-Diabetic) or 1 (Diabetic)

Dataset Size: 768 samples with 8 features each.

🛠️ Implementation Steps

The code follows a complete machine learning pipeline:

1.Import Dependencies: Uses pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.

2.Data Loading & Exploration: Loads the dataset and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and characteristics.

3.Data Preprocessing: Separates features and labels, and applies feature standardization using StandardScaler.

4.Train-Test Split: Splits the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets with stratification to maintain class distribution.

5.Model Training: An SVM classifier with linear kernel is trained on the standardized training data.

6.Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores on both training and test datasets.

7.Prediction System: Implements a complete pipeline to make predictions on new patient data.

📈 Results

The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy metrics:

Training Accuracy: Measures how well the model learned from the training data

Test Accuracy: Indicates how well the model generalizes to unseen data

(Note: The actual accuracy percentages will be displayed when you run the code with your dataset.)

🚀 How to Run this Project

1.Clone the repository:

bash : git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git

2.Navigate to the project directory.

3.Install required dependencies:

bash : pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

4.Download the dataset and update the path:

Obtain the PIMA Diabetes Dataset (commonly available as diabetes.csv)

Update the file path in the code: diabetes_dataset = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/diabetes.csv')

Run the Python script:

bash : python diabetes_prediction_(svm).py

💡 Making a Prediction

To predict diabetes risk for a new patient, provide the 8 medical parameters in the correct order to the input_data variable:

# Example format: (Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age)
input_data = (5, 166, 72, 19, 175, 25.8, 0.587, 51)

The system will output either:

'The person is not diabetic' (Prediction: 0)

'The person is diabetic' (Prediction: 1)
